uaRO: World of Your Dream introduce **Poring Coins System**

Each monster on our server drops ![Poring Coin](https://web.archive.org/web/20240314185441im_/https://uaro.net/wiki/images/f/f7/7539.gif) Poring Coin with a 5% chance.

You can also get them for completing various in-game quests and participating in events.

Poring coins are not tied to an account or a character, you can sell them, exchange them with other players or just throw them away xD.
