## Overview

Old Glast Heim (OGH) is a dungeon instance in Ragnarok Online designed for advanced players. It is steeped in dark, medieval fantasy aesthetics, offering a glimpse into the past of the ruined city of Glast Heim. Players are transported to a corrupted version of the city, filled with undead creatures, powerful knights, and sinister magic. The instance is notorious for its eerie atmosphere and challenging mechanics.

!!! Note
    This instance was designed for Renewal mechanics, but we adapted it for Pre-Renewal mechanics and implemented access to the instance as an open-world map without an instance cooldown.
