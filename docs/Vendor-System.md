## Overview
The server provides a diverse range of options for players to find, purchase, and trade items. Additionally, it implements specialized mechanisms to ensure the stability of the server's economy.

## How to get to Dewata
Dewata is a key trading area. To access Dewata, speak to the **Merchants Warp NPC** (`/navi prontera 139/171`) located in Prontera near the Main Office.

Next, head to the merchant's location and execute the `/navi` command.

Example:  
I decided to buy gold from Pedro's seller, so I'm entering his coordinates into the command:  
/navi payon 136/210

## Vendor Manager System
Stores can only be opened in towns and authorized locations. It is prohibited to open stores in unauthorized locations, such as dungeons.

To streamline the process, we have introduced the **Vendor Management System**:

- **Spot Picker NPC**: Easily select a designated spot for your shop, ensuring no overlaps with other vendors.
- **Kafra NPC**: Access Kafra services at the marketplace for added convenience.

!!! Note
    Autotrading merchants are allowed while playing on another account.

## How to create a buying store
Any player can create a Buying Store. Here are the main requirements for creating a store:

1. **Possession of the item**: You must possess the item you wish to purchase. Only certain items (e.g., Etc. items, non-brewed consumables) can be purchased.
2. **Sufficient Zeny**: You must have enough Zeny to cover the cost of the desired amount of loot.
3. **Weight Capacity**: Ensure your weight capacity is sufficient to accommodate the loot.
4. **Designated Location**: The Buying Store must be placed in an authorized location.

Buying stores are created differently depending on your character class:

### For Non-Merchant Classes:
- Head to **Morroc Pub** and find the **Black Marketeer** (`/navi morocc 45/108`).

- Purchase **Black Market Buyer Shop Licenses** for 500 Zeny each (up to 10 at a time).

### For Merchant Classes:
- Visit the **Merchant Guild** in Alberta (`/navi alberta 35/42`).
- Talk to the **Purchasing Team NPC**.

- Purchase additional licenses for 200 Zeny each (up to 50 at a time).
