All the racers move at about the same (kinda slow 😂) speed, but it’s never a straight shot — they stumble, they backtrack, and it’s hilarious to watch.

⚠️ But Wait — It’s Not Just Random! The track has hidden traps that can put racers to sleep 😴 or stun them 💫. Before each race, you can check out a monster's Endurance and Fortune stats — the higher they are, the better the monster can dodge those nasty obstacles. Still... don't bet the farm, because those stats don’t always matter. The monsters run using basic game AI, and sometimes they just wander around like they forgot there’s a race going on. 🤷‍♂️

!!! Important
        Bets close 30 seconds before the race starts.

        During the race: no items or skills allowed. 🛑

        Once it’s over, winners cash out at the receptionist 🎁, and everyone else gets booted out shortly after. If you stick around too long, you’ll be warped out and lose any rewards you might’ve earned. 😬
