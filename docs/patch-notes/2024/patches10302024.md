### 🧙 **2. Play a Trick with the Halloween Wizard**

Unleash chaos in nearby towns by summoning Halloween monsters with the **Halloween Wizard**!

**Location**: Available in all major towns (Prontera, Geffen, Payon, Alberta, Aldebaran)  
**Objective**: Use `Worn Cloth Pieces` or `Crushed Pumpkin Heads` to summon spooky `Halloween Whisper` and `Dark Lord` monsters.

#### Steps to Summon Monsters
1. Speak with the **Halloween Wizard** in any main town to initiate the event.
2. Select a town to summon monsters: **Geffen**, **Payon**, **Alberta**, or **Aldebaran**.
3. Bring `Worn Cloth Piece` or `Crushed Pumpkin Head` items to complete the summoning.
4. Watch the monsters spawn and spread chaos in the selected town!

> **Note:** You can summon up to 100 monsters at once. An announcement will notify players when more than 10 monsters are unleashed in a town.

> 💡 **Tip:** Start farming `Worn Cloth Pieces` and `Crushed Pumpkin Heads` in **Niflheim fields**! Spawn rates have been increased, giving you a better chance to gather the items quickly.

> ⚠️ **Important:** `autoloot` is disabled in event locations to ensure fair play for all participants.
