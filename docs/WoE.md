## Overview
The War of Emperium is a game feature where guilds compete to conquer a castle, which then becomes the guild’s headquarters and grants various bonuses and advantages.
Owning a castle provides several benefits for the guild. First, it unlocks access to a special Guild Dungeon available to all guild members. These dungeons contain powerful monsters that are often not found in the regular world. Additionally, every night, 4 or more treasure chests (depending on the castle’s economy level) appear in the castle, offering valuable items and equipment. Owning a castle raises the guild's prestige.
