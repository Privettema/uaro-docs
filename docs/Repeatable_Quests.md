# Repeatable EXP Quests
Repeatable EXP quests are a reliable way to level up while also collecting useful loot. They come in two forms: **item gathering**, where you turn in monster drops, and **monster hunting**, where you defeat a set number of enemies. Both give Base and Job EXP and can be repeated as often as you like, making them a steady option when regular grinding slows down.  

Some NPCs offer both quest types. You can accept both, but if they come from the same NPC you’ll need to finish or abandon the **Monster Hunting** quest before turning in items.

## Item Turn-In Quests

Item gathering quests ask you to collect **20**, **25**, or **50** of a specific item. Turning them in rewards **Base and Job EXP**, making these quests a steady way to level while farming useful drops.  

Collected items also hold value beyond quests:  
- They can be **traded or sold** to other players  
- They can be **saved** to boost future characters  

Because you decide where and how to farm, item quests are flexible—use them to earn zeny, prepare turn-ins ahead of time, or gain reliable EXP outside of your usual grinding spots.

## Monster Hunting

Hunting quests let you choose to defeat **50**, **100**, or **150** monsters for **Base and Job EXP** rewards. A 50-monster hunt can grant up to **1 Base Level** and **1 Job Level**, while 100 and 150 hunts can grant up to **2** and **3 levels**.  

These quests are especially effective in parties, since everyone’s kills count toward the total. As long as the killer is visible on screen, nearby party members will share the kill. If you pick the wrong option, you can abandon the quest to reset and choose a different hunt size.  

Unlike item turn-ins, every kill counts, no drops required. Hunting quests are also a good way to explore new maps and face a wider variety of monsters while keeping steady EXP gains.  

Please note that **Homunculus kills do not count**, but **Mercenary kills do**. You can also hold the quest, become a **Transcendent**, and then claim the reward once you meet the minimum level requirement.  

### Hunting Quest List
Rewards shown are for a **50-monster** turn-in. For **100** or **150**, simply double or triple the values.  

Monsters marked with `*` are on maps that require a quest to access.
