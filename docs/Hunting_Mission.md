With the update, you now have the capability to undertake Hunting Missions. Upon completion of a mission, you will be rewarded with *Experience*, *Zeny*, and *Mission Points* that can be redeemed at a *Mission Store*.

To get the mission, talk to the NPC *Hobota* in Prontera Inn (**/navi prontera 204/192**)

Please note the following restrictions:

- Mission conditions may be reset as many times as desired, with each reset costing *50,000 zeny*.
- Only one mission can be completed every *12 hours*.
- Missions can only be taken on one character per account.
- Monsters that are killed by your party members within your screen view will be counted as being killed by you.
