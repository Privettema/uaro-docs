## Overview

Endless Cellar is one of the most popular instances in Ragnarok Online, designed for team-based gameplay. It is part of the so-called "endless" instances, offering players a challenge in the form of a series of dungeons filled with increasingly powerful monsters, mini-bosses, and mighty MVPs. This is not only an engaging PvE experience but also a place where players can earn valuable rewards and test their skills in teamwork. Itâ€™s a perfect challenge for guilds and friends who aim to overcome obstacles together. The tower is always ready to challenge those seeking adventure in the world of Ragnarok Online.

## Mechanics

- All party members must be present on Misty Island at the time the Party Leader clicks to stone to initiate the dungeon start.
- Any member who attempts to join an in progress party will automatically be kicked out of the instance.
- Original members of the party may leave the dungeon and re-enter as long as a member is still active within the dungeon (If all members exit, the instance will be deleted and cooldown commences)
- Create a party and run Solo or with a party of up to 12 total people (11+1) Dungeon instance creation starts at lowest level completed out of all party members
- Experience and loot and obtained per kill and will be issued depending on party share options
- Bubble Gum and EXP manuals do not effect drop rate and/or exp rates
- Loot/EXP is accounted based
- Level 85+ to enter
- Monsters remaining per floor will be announced starting with 5 remaining
- Rentry currently restricted on floor 77 (Will be changed soon, but as it currently sits you cant re-enter on 77 if you leave)
