## Overview

Endless Cellar is one of the most popular instances in Ragnarok Online, designed for team-based gameplay. It is part of the so-called "endless" instances, offering players a challenge in the form of a series of dungeons filled with increasingly powerful monsters, mini-bosses, and mighty MVPs. This is not only an engaging PvE experience but also a place where players can earn valuable rewards and test their skills in teamwork. Itâ€™s a perfect challenge for guilds and friends who aim to overcome obstacles together. The tower is always ready to challenge those seeking adventure in the world of Ragnarok Online.

## Mechanics

- Create a party and run Solo or with a party of up to 12 total people (11+1) Dungeon instance creation starts at lowest level completed out of all party members
- Experience is gained per completed level and split between party members within the dungeon (triggers upon touching the completed level portal)
- Loot is party share. All equipment and cards that drop will be listed in chat box attached to who will receive these items in their claim window
- Only items that are claimed within the dungeon itself are after full clear with Pori Pori kill, Arc Pori Pori will individually issue end dungeon rewards
- Bubble Gum + EXP manuals do not effect drop rate and/or exp rates

- All loot gained within the dungeon will be attached to the players account and can be claimed at any time throughout the weekly EC cooldown from any character
- Loot will be listed in dialogue windows with the option to claim or ignore and move to the next page.
- There are weight and item count checks within the script to ensure you don't lose items, auto drop when parameters are not met
- When inventory full, there will be a storeage only Kafra on the island to utilize for QoL
- Must be present on level completion at time of level clear to receive the loot into your claim window


- All progress of levels and experience, loot are account shared and also tied to UniqueID (PC ID) can be picked up or left off at any point within the dungeon
- Accounts with fully claim experience, items for the week can still join other players dungeons to assist but will receive no loot or exp
- Lockout timers are fully disabled, you may leave and rejoin an instance in progress (automatically caught up to progress of party leader)
- For levels completed in your absence, you will still have a chance to join another instance to get exp + loot credit at another time
- Adding new party members in the middle of a run will automatically boot out party members and require the party lead to create a new instance.
- Level 85+ to enter
