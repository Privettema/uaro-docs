## Something missing?
### Our approach
We aim for a classic, balanced experience, so you won’t find many of the shortcut NPCs common on heavily customized servers. Traditional quests are all part of the journey here.

### Got ideas?
If there’s a feature you’d love to see, drop your suggestions in our [Discord channel #server-suggestions](https://discord.com/channels/702960460168953946/1197554200817696898).

### Common Unbalanced NPCs Excluded
- **No Job Changer NPC**: We keep it classic, so you’ll advance through the [traditional job quests](https://irowiki.org/wiki/Category:Job_Change_Guid) just like old times.
- **No General Warper**: Instead of unlimited warps, our [dungeon-based system](Warper_System.md) keeps exploration fun while staying convenient. 
- **No Healer or Buffer NPC**: No instant full heals or buff stations here. Potions, inns, and party play keep things true to the original game.
