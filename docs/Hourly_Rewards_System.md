# Hourly Rewards System

In the top right corner of the screen, you will see a timer.

For every hour in the game (characters on @autotrade do not count), you will receive **10 Coins** that can be exchanged for symbolic prizes.

You can get your prizes from the NPC Gold Point Manager in Prontera Inn, or press on the timer anywhere to make the NPC Gold Point Manager appear:
