<!-- Placeholder -->
- **Super Novice – 3 Skills Added (Nerfed)**
!!! note "Super Novice ATK Behavior"
    The added “ATK” behaves like **Sword Mastery** (applied in damage formula) and **will not** appear on `ALT+A` Attack stat.

  ![Super Novice Skills](patch-notes/2025/img/sn-skill-list.webp)

- **Gunslinger – Adjustment**:
  ```
  - SP: 15 → 10
  - Coin: 2 → 1
  - Duration: 30s → 60s
  ```
- **Preserve (Skill)**:
  ```
  - Now a toggle on/off.
  - Persists through logout.
  - Still dispellable unless Soul Linked.
  ```
- **Cart Revo / Cart Termination**: Removed **weight** from formula (acts as if cart weight is **max**).
- **Shadow Slash (Ninja)**: Correctly flagged as **physical melee**.
- **Magnus Exorcismus**: Damage ticks correctly even when caster is `Stunned / Petrified / Frozen`.
- **Sighttrasher**: Now checks for **obstructions** before applying damage.
- 
⚡ **Autospell Bolts** at max level are now **level 5.**
🛡️ **Stun status now bypasses** Safety Wall **when using Cart Termination**, as intended. Stun now properly applies **through Safety Wall**, restoring intended PvP mechanics.

Gunslinger:

| Skill Name         | Change                                |
|--------------------|---------------------------------------|
| Rapid Shot         | SP cost per level 1–10: `12–20`.     |
|                    | AfterCastDelay: `1 sec → 0.75 sec`.  |
| Full Buster        | AfterCastDelay: `2 sec`.             |
|                    | SP cost level 5–10: `35`.            |
| Triple Action      | SP cost: `20 → 12`.                  |
| Flip the Coin      | SP cost: `2 → 1`. Success Rate: `100%`.


<!-- Needs clarification -------------------------------------->
Something about "Fame Points" Decaying by 10% monthly. Is this related to rankings?

Cart term / mammo 500z when possessing a certain item? 7/4/25

- **Rapid Shower (Gunslinger):**
  ```
  - Lv 1–2 = 1 ammo
  - Lv 3–4 = 2
  - Lv 5–6 = 3
  - Lv 7–8 = 4
  - Lv 9–10 = 5
  ```
- `Throw Zeny (Ninja)`: Cost disabled in BG.
- `Isilla Card`: Now applies to both `AoE` and `Single-Target` magic.
- Amplify Magic mechanic refactored:
  > Now triggers for each damage tick during casting (`Meteor Storm`, `Storm Gust`, `LoV`).

<!-- Which monk skills? -->
Removed the fixed target from some combo skills. 

<!-- Does this mean it has zero aftercase delay? -->
Removed an incorrect afterCastActDelay from Sacrifice

<!-- Not sure what skills these are/do an internet is down -->
Lif Homunculus has been reverted to the classic version where Mental Change resets upon respawning the homunculus.

Mind Breaker skill now shows icon and updates status

Levels 6-10 Plagiarized Water Ball are no longer melee attack skills.

Cold Heart / Black Cat accessories now complete combos with Rogue Treasure

Dragon Fire Formation no longer works under Land Protector.

Edited Weapon Perfection levels 1-5 for better consistency. Client-side description updated also.

Reject sword damage cannot exceed the caster's HP.

Fixed some interactions of Ki Translation
It should fail with a skill failure message and not consume requirements when:
- being cast on Gunslinger class
- being cast on a player that already has 5 spheres
- being cast on friendly non-player units (e.g. Mercenary)


Changed Poisoning Weapon to show the type of poison used when applied

Fixed the range checks of Blade Stop:
- Fixed the target's (as in triggering attack target, and Blade Stop caster) equipped weapon wrongly affecting the skill's working range.
- Success range is changed to 2, to match the official behavior.
- In pre-re, changed it to always succeed against player attackers regardless of range.
- Changed it to always succeed for non-player casters regardless of range (custom Hercules behavior, officially only players may cast Blade Stop).
  

Fixed the stacking of Poem of The Netherworld to match the behavior described in the 2012.08.22 official patch notes.
- it cannot be placed over another instance of the skill
- when trying to do so, it should show a position error to client
  

Fixed some SC counters (including Storm Gust) not getting reset to 0 when a unit dies.


Soul Destroyer: The range of Soul Destroyer has been corrected to 9 cells. Fixed range and cast time for Soul Destroyer.


Slow Grace Effect: The Slow Grace effect will now cancel upon death.


<!-- Does this need to be included or was it just a bug? -->
Fixed some interactions of Absorb Spirit Sphere
It should fail and not consume SP when:
- the target player doesn't have spheres
- the target player is of Gunslinger class (due to teh game implementation not allowing them to have spheres)
- the target player is friendly
It should fail and consume SP when:
- used on a BOSS monster
- used on a non-boss monster, but failing the 20% check
- used on non-player units (like mercenaries)
- moved the target check to condition cast end

<!-- Battlegrounds page content -->
Devotion in Battlegrounds now works without the need for a party.

High Jump and Running Soul Linker skills now work within Battlegrounds.
