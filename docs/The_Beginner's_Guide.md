# The Beginner's Guide

Logging into Ragnarok Online is fun, but newer players will benefit from having some knowledge of what will occur during the game. Remember, though, that Ragnarok, like all MMORPGs, is dynamic and things constantly change.

## **Creating A Character**

Before you can start playing, you need to set up a **character** (the person you will play as). Once you have logged in, you will be presented with a Server choice window. After this, you will see a number of empty boxes. Over time, you can fill these boxes with various characters. Therefore, multiple characters may be played by a single player.

You will now need to choose your character's appearance, name, and base Stats. Select a hairstyle and color (the clothes you wear will be determined later by your class), and fill in a name.

Now you need to give your character his basic **Stats**. It is recommended that you look at the various **Classes** and select one you like. You can play as any class you want, but first, select a first class or expanded class type. As you progress in the game, your level will rise, and eventually, you can then change into more advanced classes.

There are 6 stats: STR, AGI, VIT, INT, DEX, and LUK. You'll notice that you can only achieve a certain set of stats right now; you can raise them later in the game. Check out your desired class's information and find out which stats you need first. For example, if you would like to be a Swordman, it would usually be among STR, DEX, and VIT or AGI. However, since you can't get all of them, just try getting a mix. Don't worry, it's normal to have a few messy stats.

Now create your character and follow the walkthrough provided in the Novice Training Grounds! <copylink> some text </copylink>

## **Introduction to the World of Ragnarok**

The world is divided up into a vast variety of regions. There are **Towns** where you are safe and can chat with other players; there are **Fields**, the regions right out of towns where you can encounter wild monsters; finally, there are **Dungeons**, where more challenging travels await.

### **Finding Where You Are**

Use the `/where` command in the chatbox to find out where you are. You will get a map name and coordinates. If you're completely lost and have some friends, you can give them your location and they'll find you.

**Tip:** Remember, you have a World Map to help you find your way if you get lost.

### **Traveling**

Getting from place to place is a common task you will need to do. There are many ways to get around.

#### Returning to Your Save Point

Each character will have a **save point**. This is the place where you will return to if all goes wrong (for example, you get killed). To set your save point, find a **Kafra** in one of the cities (you can ask around if you don't know where).

If you get lost in your journeys and just want to get home, you can return to your save point by dying, using a Butterfly Wing item, or relogging (going to the "select character" screen and back) on certain maps.
