# Quality of Life Improvements

At World of Your Dream, we are dedicated to providing the ultimate gaming experience for our players. One of our top priorities is to actively listen to player feedback and use it to improve the game.

We are constantly working to add new features and improvements that will enhance the gameplay and make it even more enjoyable for everyone.

From new game modes to updates to existing content, we are committed to making World of Your Dream a truly immersive and satisfying experience for all players.


## Increased Natural Recovery

![Fast Regen](img/Improvements/Fastregensit.gif)

When a player is idle or not engaged in combat and has not been hit by a mob, they will experience a significant increase in HP and SP regeneration.

When a player sits, they will regain 3% of their maximum HP and SP every 1.5 seconds.

The regeneration is based on a fixed percentage, rather than a fixed value, so it will always take approximately 1 minute to fully regenerate from 0%.

### Restrictions
- When the character is overweight, recovery does not work
- Delayed after using Asura Strike for 5 minutes
- All other restrictions also apply to increased recovery



## Superior Inns

![Inn Benefits](img/Improvements/Inn-Employee-NPC.png)

Inns have always been a safe stop between adventures, giving players a place to recover and get ready for what’s ahead. On uaRO, we’ve expanded on that idea to make inns even more useful by adding features that support both newcomers and veterans.

For **10,000z**, inns will fully restore your HP/SP and provide Blessing and Increase Agility buffs for 10 minutes. Every inn also includes Hobota for [Hunting Missions](Hunting_Mission.md) and our [Enhanced Tool Dealer](Dealers.md#enhanced-tool-dealer) for quick access to supplies.

## Enhanced Tool Dealer
Every town has a Tool Dealer located inside the inn, offering a wide range of supplies for your journey. Arrows of many types — including Iron, Silver, and Fire — plus traps are no longer limited to specific shops, so you can pick them up wherever you go. You’ll also find essentials like Berserk Potions, Yggdrasil Leaves, and Blue Gemstones, making it easy to stay stocked as you progress.

## Remastered Novice Location

![Remastered Novice Location](img/Improvements/novice-location-1.png)

Our server features an enhanced Training Grounds built with the latest renewal mechanics, offering a smoother and more efficient leveling experience. The Renewal version delivers the same immersive gameplay as pre-renewal, but with the added convenience of not requiring players to allocate stat points at the start.

This lets new players focus on honing skills and learning core mechanics without the stress of early complex decisions about character development. Quests from the Job NPCs provide valuable supplies and EXP for those who invest a bit of time, making it a simple and rewarding way to progress while gaining a deeper understanding of the game’s systems.

## RODEX Mail System
The RODEX mail system is one of the most convenient tools in uaRO, letting you stay supplied no matter where you are. For a small fee, you can send and receive items directly from the field instead of heading back to town. This makes it easy to restock consumables, free up weight, and keep hunting without interruption.

**Key Features**

- **Fee**: 2,500z per item stack, 10,000z total for 5 item stacks
- **Weight Limit**: Items up to 2,000 total weight can be added
- **Short Term Storage**: Mail remains in your inbox for 14 days, then is deleted automatically
- **Restrictions**: Only tradeable items may be sent, check an item's *Movement Restrictions* in the item details
- **WoE Blocked**: Not available during War of Emperium

You can queue multiple mails, open them when you’re ready, and use the system as a lightweight storage option between runs. With RODEX, your next solution is always just a few clicks away.
