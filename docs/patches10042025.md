# 🌙 **Night PvP System**

!!! note "Be prepared. Nighttime is no longer safe." During nighttime, PvP may be activated on all MvP maps with a 50% chance. When active, players can attack each other without penalty. This is a server-wide system intended to add high-risk conflict zones during specific hours.

- **Night lasts 2 hours**, **Day lasts 4 hours**
- **PvP is enabled on all MvP maps**

- Use `@pvpinfo` to view your **PvP stats and standing**
