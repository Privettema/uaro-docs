To start this instance, you need to go to Lutie and find the NPC Catherine Jet Johnson (**/navi xmas 237/303**). Talk to her and agree to help her.

## Storyline

Once, in a small town Lutie, there stood a toy factory, the heart of the community. All the townspeople worked there, crafting dolls and other toys. After a long workday, they would gather together, enjoying tea and gingerbread cookies. But the happy times did not last long. People began to leave the town, the factory's business became less and less profitable, and eventually, the decision was made to shut it down.

The last person to remain at the factory was the master dollmaker, a man who created the most beautiful and lifelike dolls. On the day of the factory’s closure, he finished his final creation—a stunning doll named Celine Kimi. He dressed her in the finest attire, gave her a name, and it seemed as if he was saying farewell not just to the factory, but to his dream. In that very moment, the production lines came to a halt forever.

But the story did not end there. Kimi… came to life. Whether it was the dollmaker’s craftsmanship, his heartfelt devotion, or something more mysterious, she became a living being. However, her existence was filled with sorrow and rage. She remained within the abandoned factory, as if bound to it.

One day, a former factory worker returned to the building, only to find a horrifying scene: the dollmaker lay lifeless on the ground, while Kimi stood motionless beside him, her gaze empty and hollow. Then, everything faded into darkness.

When the girl regained consciousness, she was outside… and her face had changed forever. She had no memory of what had happened, no knowledge of whether Kimi had been responsible for her transformation, but she felt one thing—she needed to uncover the truth.

Yet, fear kept her from returning alone. She needed help. And now, the choice is yours: do you have the courage to enter the factory, face Kimi, and uncover the mystery of that fateful day?

### Factory Area No.1

??? note "Storyline, click to expand"

    Once, Factory No.1 was a place where toys and dolls were stored before being gifted to children. It was always bustling with activity, and workers strictly followed the rules. If someone wasn't wearing their uniform, the guards would immediately step in and reprimand them.
    
    But now, everything had changed. The silence was suddenly broken by a loud announcement:
    
    — Wake up, toy factory working time has come…
    
    Something was wrong. Dolls and toys were now moving on their own, replacing the workers who once filled this place with life.
   
    — Waste and other debris should be kept clear from work areas. This is to keep you safe at all times.
    
    It looked as if the factory was still operating, only now, ghostly entities had taken over.
   
    — Let's make presents for every child's dream today.
    
    But this was no place for joy. Ahead lay the final section of the factory, where all production lines needed to be shut down.
   
    — Please start product line No.1. Don't forget to wear a safety helmet! This means you, Bob!
   
    What if the toys and gift boxes could be restored to their original state?
    
    — We should… return them to how they were… Yes… — the voice trembled. — But do we need to fight them? I… I don’t know how exactly…
    
    Another ominous announcement echoed through the eerie silence:

    — All employees must wear a proper uniform and identification. Please check with security if you do not have yours.

    — God… I hope the guards are still human…

    There had to be some old uniform boxes left somewhere. Yes, there they were, right behind them.

    — You’d better change into the uniform. Luckily, I still have my employee card.

    From here, everyone would have to find their own way.

    — I'll find my way around. Let’s meet near the second production line.

    The final words came with a strained smile:

    — Don’t lose hope—it’s a toy factory! It can’t be that bad… right?

1. After the introduction, speak to the Myst Case NPC to transform into a Red Cookie. You must remain in this form while exploring. Avoid interacting with other NPCs aside from the transformation Myst Case unless you are properly transformed—doing so while untransformed will trigger multiple Nightmare Cruisers to spawn. There are several Myst Case NPCs positioned around the corners of the room. Be sure to speak to one before your transformation expires to maintain your form.

2. Defeat Vicious Cookies and Evil Dwelling Boxes scattered throughout the area. Once enough enemies are eliminated, an announcement will signal completion, and any remaining monsters will disappear.

3. Next, move to the northwest section of the room and interact with the Green Cookie NPC. You must be in the Red Cookie form to proceed. If you are not transformed, the NPC will temporarily vanish before reappearing and will not respond to you until you regain the Red Cookie form.

4. After completing the dialogue, locate the new Myst Case NPC to transform into a Myst Case. You must be in this form to advance to the next area. 
5. Finally, enter the portal to the right of the Green Cookie to progress to the next phase.

### Factory Area No.2

??? note "Storyline, click to expand"
    You made it here safely – that’s good. This place was once Factory No.2, filled with life and people. But now, everything has changed…  
    
    While I was coming here, I realized something. The children… There are many of them. Their souls look terrifying, yet there is so much sorrow in them. They are suffering, and perhaps the only way to help them is to grant them peace. If they attack you, please set them free. Luckily, they won’t harm me.  
    
    There’s one more thing. If you come across a worker toy still performing its duty, ask it about the doll maker. If it remembers him, maybe the master will finally find peace. That is our only hope…  
    
    If you manage to gather all the clues, continue searching in other areas. In the meantime, I will find the place where I last saw the doll maker.
    
    Sorry that I can't be of more help. See you soon.

1. After speaking with Catherine, interact with the Myst Case NPC again to transform into a Red Cookie. Just like in the first phase, you must remain transformed while exploring; otherwise, Cruisers will spawn in large numbers throughout the room. If you accidentally re-enter the portal you came from before completing this phase, you’ll need to return to the first room, transform into a Myst Case again, and then make your way back to the second room.

2. In this area, you will find 10 worker NPCs (Green Cookies). Speak with each of them and listen to their stories. While they are talking, you won’t be able to move, use skills, or consume items, but be aware that monsters can still target you during this time.

3. Once you’ve spoken to all 10 workers, an announcement will trigger, and all remaining monsters in the room will disappear. After that, go back through the portal you entered from, then proceed through the northern portal to advance to the next phase.
