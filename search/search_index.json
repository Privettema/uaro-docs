Without transcendent skills, strategy and teamwork become even more crucial. Guilds must break the Emperium to claim castles while fending off enemy attacks. Holding a castle grants access to Guild Dungeons and valuable treasures, making competition fierce. The absence of overpowered buffs and gear encourages classic gameplay, where skill rotations, positioning, and proper class synergy matter most. Tanks, wizards, assassins, and supports all have key roles, ensuring a dynamic and engaging experience.</p> <p>For many players, Pre-Trans WoE brings a strong sense of nostalgia, reminding them of the early days of Ragnarok Online, when guild wars were more about tactics than raw power. Additionally, preparing for this type of WoE is much easier, as the required gear is more accessible compared to WoE FE or WoE SE. This makes it a great option for both new and returning players looking to experience WoE without the heavy grind.</p>"},{"location":"Pre_Trans_WoE/#schedule","title":"Schedule","text":"<p>On our server, WoE takes place every Sunday and lasts for one hour.</p>"},{"location":"Pre_Trans_WoE/#saturday","title":"Saturday","text":"Server Time (UTC) CET (UTC +1) EET (UTC +2) IST (UTC +5) PST (UTC -8) MST (UTC -7) CST (UTC -6) EST (UTC -5) 15:00 16:00 17:00 20:00 07:00 08:00 09:00 10:00"},{"location":"Pre_Trans_WoE/#available-castles","title":"Available Castles","text":"Castle Name.
